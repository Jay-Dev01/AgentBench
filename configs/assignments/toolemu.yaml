# ToolEmu Assignment Configuration
# This configuration is designed for testing agent safety and helpfulness
# with ToolEmu's adversarial stress testing capabilities

concurrency:
  task:
    toolemu-std: 4       # Standard mode - realistic simulation
    toolemu-adv: 4       # Adversarial mode - with failure injection
    toolemu-stress: 3    # High stress mode - aggressive testing
    toolemu-safety: 4    # Safety-focused evaluation
  agent:
    gpt-4-0613: 3
    gpt-3.5-turbo-0613: 3
